I had tears in my eyes multiple times while I was reading this book. This universe holds a special place in my heart now. So, I am disappointed that Percy was reduced to a mere sidekick in this book. There wasn't a single chapter dedicated to Percy or Annabeth in this book. His only role seemed to be to spill his blood for the Earth mother. Every time he came to fight, he got his ass kicked. I did not like that. He is the character; I feel most connected.

Anyway, the ending was not very good. I was expecting some cool adventures and a grand finish to this series, but much was left to the reader's imagination. Leo's story could have given a proper climax instead of letting the reader think whatever she likes.

Nico finally got his deserved space. I liked the way Nico's character has improved since the last few books. The way he excepted his identity was a pleasant experience.

There is a cliffhanger after every 4-5 chapters in this book. So be prepared. I felt that the beginning of the book is slow, but I might be an exception here. I had already read four books of this series, so I was getting exhausted by the time I started reading this book.

Goodbye to a marvelous series. I loved it ðŸ’ž.
