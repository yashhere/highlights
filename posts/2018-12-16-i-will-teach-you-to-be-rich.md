It was my first book on the topic of personal finance. I am entirely new to managing money, so I thought it would be a good idea to gain some knowledge before trying anything crazy. I must say, this book has not disappointed me. I do not know, how other personal-finance books are written, but from my point of view, I learned a lot by reading this book. I have already implemented some of the ideas mentioned in this book.

One of the best things that I learned from this book is to automate everything. As a Computer Engineer, it is easily relatable. The author says that if you enable automatic transfers to transfer money from your checking account to different accounts, then you will not look at the money, and hence you will not have the urge to spend the money. A psychological win, isn't it?

The author argues in favor of passive investment - the buy and hold strategy. One of the main takeaways from this book was just to get started. The author shows that it is better to do something 85% right than to wait for a long time to gain perfection. Especially in the case of investing, time matters a lot.

Before reading this book, I knew only about Mutual Funds (that's the only thing that is being advertised nowadays), however, now I know that Index Funds are a better deal and give almost similar returns in comparison of Mutual Funds while keeping the expense ratios very low.

Most of the content in the book is US specific, so I would not be able to apply the techniques from this book as it is, however, the financial literacy that I gained from this book is still valuable.
