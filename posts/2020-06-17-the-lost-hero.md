I was quite impressed with the Percy Jackson series. But this book is on a different level. I like the connection between the Roman and Greek gods. Western mythology is an entirely new experience for someone like me who grew up listening to the fantastic Hindu mythological stories.

Rick Riordan has done a fantastic job making the violent mythology (I presume) suitable for kids. The way he had mapped the old characters into the modern world is just spectacular. I wish somebody would do the same for Indian mythology as well.

I can't wait to finish the next book. In fact, I have already started. :)
