This book has changed something about my thought process. I learned many new and cruel things about humankind. Notably, the repeated mentions and descriptions about animal husbandry were disturbing. This book excels in telling various side stories that were conveniently ignored by the Human Historians till now. They say, winners, get to write the history. From an Indian perspective, this book talks very little about Asia and in particular India, Hinduism, and Indus Valley Civilization. As far as I remember, there are only one or two mentions of this civilization. If not most magnificent, Indus Valley Civilization should get an equal place to its contemporary cultures. But this book fails to give that place.

The description of Modern civilization and its side-effects on the other animal is worrying. The author was successful in provoking my thought process. The science fiction like predictions is worth noting. Although these predictions should be taken a pinch of salt, they might prove to be correct, if history takes the author's intended course of direction.

I thoroughly enjoyed the book. Highly recommended.
