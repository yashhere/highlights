Most people can neither intimately know, nor gossip effectively about, more than 150 human beings."},{"loc":"1407-1407","authors":["Yuval Noah Harari"],"date":"2019-02-05T23:12:37.000Z","content":"One of history’s few iron laws is that luxuries tend to become necessities and to spawn new obligations."},{"loc":"1559-1560","authors":["Yuval Noah Harari"],"date":"2019-02-06T21:24:42.000Z","content":"…attachment to ‘my house’ and separation from the neighbours became the psychological hallmark of a much more self-centred creature."},{"loc":"1609-1609","authors":["Yuval Noah Harari"],"date":"2019-02-06T21:33:02.000Z","content":"History is something that very few people have been doing while everyone else was ploughing fields and carrying water buckets."},{"loc":"1830-1835","authors":["Yuval Noah Harari"],"date":"2019-02-06T22:01:12.000Z","content":"Romanticism tells us that in order to make the most of our human potential we must have as many different experiences as we can. We must open ourselves to a wide spectrum of emotions; we must sample various kinds of relationships; we must try different cuisines; we must learn to appreciate different styles of music. One of the best ways to do all that is to break free from our daily routine, leave behind our familiar setting, and go travelling in distant lands, where we can ‘experience’ the culture, the smells, the tastes and the norms of other people. We hear again and again the romantic myths about ‘how a new experience opened my eyes and changed my life’."},{"loc":"1835-1838","authors":["Yuval Noah Harari"],"date":"2019-02-06T22:01:27.000Z","content":"Consumerism tells us that in order to be happy we must consume as many products and services as possible. If we feel that something is missing or not quite right, then we probably need to buy a product (a car, new clothes, organic food) or a service (housekeeping, relationship therapy, yoga classes). Every television commercial is another little legend about how consuming some product or service will make life better."},{"loc":"2051-2053","authors":["Yuval Noah Harari"],"date":"2019-02-07T21:49:35.000Z","content":"The most important impact of script on human history is precisely this: it has gradually changed the way humans think and view the world.

Yet the two values contradict each other. Equality can be ensured only by curtailing the freedoms of those who are better off. Guaranteeing that every individual will be free to do as he wishes inevitably short-changes equality."},{"loc":"2529-2529","authors":["Yuval Noah Harari"],"date":"2019-02-08T21:55:40.000Z","content":"Consistency is the playground of dull minds."},{"loc":"3631-3635","authors":["Yuval Noah Harari"],"date":"2019-02-11T22:26:59.000Z","content":"This is one of the distinguishing marks of history as an academic discipline – the better you know a particular historical period, the harder it becomes to explain why things happened one way and not another. Those who have only a superficial knowledge of a certain period tend to focus only on the possibility that was eventually realised. They offer a just-so story to explain with hindsight why that outcome was inevitable. Those more deeply informed about the period are much more cognisant of the roads not taken."},{"loc":"3653-3654","authors":["Yuval Noah Harari"],"date":"2019-02-11T22:30:53.000Z","content":"To acknowledge that history is not deterministic is to acknowledge that it is just a coincidence that most people today believe in nationalism, capitalism and human rights."},{"loc":"3677-3678","authors":["Yuval Noah Harari"],"date":"2019-02-11T22:34:06.000Z","content":"We study history not to know the future but to widen our horizons, to understand that our present situation is neither natural nor inevitable, and that we consequently have many more possibilities before us than we imagine."},{"loc":"3920-3921","authors":["Yuval Noah Harari"],"date":"2019-02-12T22:19:41.000Z","content":"…undisputed monarch of all sciences was theology."},{"loc":"4710-4710","authors":["Yuval Noah Harari"],"date":"2019-02-14T21:55:32.000Z","content":"Credit enables us to build the present at the expense of the future."},{"loc":"4758-4758","authors":["Yuval Noah Harari"],"date":"2019-02-14T22:01:42.000Z","content":"Egoism is altruism."},{"loc":"5271-5272","authors":["Yuval Noah Harari"],"date":"2019-02-16T15:54:21.000Z","content":"The tragedy of industrial agriculture is that it takes great care of the objective needs of animals, while neglecting their subjective needs."},{"loc":"5336-5339","authors":["Yuval Noah Harari"],"date":"2019-02-16T16:01:58.000Z","content":"In medieval Europe, aristocrats spent their money carelessly on extravagant luxuries, whereas peasants lived frugally, minding every penny.
