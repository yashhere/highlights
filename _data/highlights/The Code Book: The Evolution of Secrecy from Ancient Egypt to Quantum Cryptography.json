Atbash involves taking each letter, noting the number of places it is from the beginning of the alphabet, and replacing it with a letter that is an equal number of places from the end of the alphabet. In English this would mean that a, at the beginning of the alphabet, is replaced by Z, at the end of the alphabet, b is replaced by Y, and so on. The term atbash itself hints at the substitution it describes, because it consists of the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet, aleph, followed by the last letter taw, and then there is the second letter, beth, followed by the second to last letter shin. An example of atbash appears in Jeremiah 25: 26 and 51: 41, where “Babel” is replaced by the word “Sheshach”; the first letter of Babel is beth, the second letter of the Hebrew alphabet, and this is replaced by shin, the second-to-last letter; the second letter of Babel is also beth, and so it too is replaced by shin; and the last letter of Babel is lamed, the twelfth letter of the Hebrew alphabet, and this is replaced by kaph, the twelfth-to-last letter."},{"loc":"557-557","authors":["Simon Singh"],"date":"2018-11-20T23:23:08.000Z","content":"“A man is crazy who writes a secret in any other way than one which will conceal it from the vulgar.”"},{"loc":"612-615","authors":["Simon Singh"],"date":"2018-11-20T23:35:13.000Z","content":"…a code is defined as substitution at the level of words or phrases, whereas a cipher is defined as substitution at the level of letters.
